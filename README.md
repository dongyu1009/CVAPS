# CVAPS algorithm

An algorithm implementation of Change-Vector Analysis in Posterior Probability Space on Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform 

# brief instruction 

There are 2 files, and each of them is a single algorithm which can be applied on GEE.

**cvaps.js**
CVAPS algorithm alone.

**cvaps_ndvi.js**
CVAPS-NDVI algorithm.

The following params (variables) should be altered by users :

 - image_t1 : Remote Sensing image in T1;
 - image_t2 : Remote Sensing image in T2;
 - class_t1 : classification in T1;
